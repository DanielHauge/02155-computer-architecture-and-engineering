\section*{Discussion}

- Testing was nice, but i feel into some bad habits of just debugging w/o constructing additional tests.
- Testing would have been better to define tests based on exact knowledge of how RISC-V works instead of guessing from cheatsheet.
- The structure was nice, and provided a good overview of the code etc.
- The seperation would have made extensions easier to implement once the foundation was built.
- Using uint32 made most operations trivial and predictable.
- Using arrays made memory implementations very simple and trivial.
- Although a more advanced virtual memory setup could be cool.
