\section*{A1.3}

\subsection*{a.}
Determining the execution time of the program can be found by finding total amount of cycles and dividing by the clock rate using the following equation.

$$ \frac{\textbf{CPU Clock Cycles}}{\textbf{Clock rate}} = \textbf{CPU Time} $$

Using given information to get execution time.

$$\frac{10^6\cdot0.35\cdot3+10^6\cdot0.4\cdot4+10^6\cdot0.25\cdot5}{2000000000} = 0.00195 $$

\subsection*{b.}

Using same equation, with new given information to get execution time.

$$\frac{10^6\cdot0.35\cdot3+10^6\cdot0.35\cdot4+10^6\cdot0.25\cdot5+10^6\cdot0.05\cdot6}{2000000000} = 0.002 $$

With a 500 micro seconds longer execution time, the modifications are not advantageous for the benchmark.
